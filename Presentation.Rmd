```

## Introduction

Using the Gapminder data, I was curious to see the relationship between country CO2 emissions and life expectancy. To get a standardized result, I utilized the data sets for CO2 emissions measured in tonnes per person and life expectancy in years.  

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
