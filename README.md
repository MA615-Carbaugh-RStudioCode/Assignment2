MA615 Assignment 2

Due: October 8

This assignment uses the Gapminder website in order to practice data wrangling, visualization, building html files, and etc.

My particular project plots co2 emissions vs. life expectancy in order to locate some sort of trend. Tidyverse was used throughout, specifically through use of mutate, filter, inner_join, and ggplot.
